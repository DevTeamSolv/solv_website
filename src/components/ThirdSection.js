                                    We want to revolutionise the set standard for donations. Here at Solution Token, we want to remove all administrative fees and costs so that your donations are completely transparent and cost free.<span className="hide-text">  Furthermore, because we are employing blockchain technology, misappropriation, embezzlement, and fraud are all but impossible. In simple words, you will be able to track your donation and see that one hundred percent of your donated funds reach their intended recipient - giving you the peace of mind that you deserve when doing a good deed.</span><br/><a onClick={this.readMore.bind(this, "b1")}>read more</a>

                                    Our platforms are based off of real world problems to provide a real world solution. As technologically advanced and innovative a time we live in, there are still issues in the world without<span className="hide-text"> real resolutions. Therefore, Solution Token has decided to tackle these problems through long term solutions instead of temporary fixes. Our technology will adapt as we move forward into moving the world forward.</span><br/><a onClick={this.readMore.bind(this, "b2")}>read more</a>

                                <p>
                                    While cryptocurrencies are advancing ever closer to mass adoption, they are not a mainstream, commonly accepted currency. Therefore, we have decided that we will not base the company purely on crypto<span className="hide-text"> but use both Fiat and crypto in correlation with each other. Doing this it will help the company deal with potential issues regarding finances in a smooth way without the obstacles that are exclusive to crypto. Since we are demonstrating real world implementation at our inception, it makes sense for us to have a fiat income stream to fund company resources and productivity.</span><br/><a onClick={this.readMore.bind(this, "b3")}>read more</a>

                                    Everyone’s a winner! Let's think for a second, what's the best way to get everyone involved while simultaneously benefiting others, effortlessly? Our finding is that by having multiple correlated platforms<span className="hide-text"> we will be able to create a cross platform experience. By using one platform of Solution Token, it allows someone else to indirectly benefit from this use, even if they are using a different platform.</span><br/><a onClick={this.readMore.bind(this, "b4")}>read more</a>

                                    Let's focus on giving back. Our main goal is to help those in need. Through the support and use of our platforms, users will help us create Solutions. For example, every time someone gets involved with our<span className="hide-text"> Water Solutions platform, such as by buying a simple water bottle, it allows us to not just gain fiat backing but help fund wells and clean water sources in places without running water. This is Solution Token’s way of paying it forward while simultaneously introducing crypto to the world.</span><br/><a onClick={this.readMore.bind(this, "b5")}>read more</a>

What makes Solution merchandise special is that every item will have<span className="hide-text"> a unique QR code which you will be able to scan for fun prizes and even Tokens! These prizes can be used and redeemed on our other platforms, such as Street QRed or even SOLV Wallet. From the public's support, this will be one form of fiat backing for the company. We will also hold fun competitions and events that people can enter while wearing our merchandise.</span><br/><a onClick={this.readMore.bind(this, "b6")}>read more</a>

Our goal is to not only be a <span className="hide-text">household name as a real world company or a crypto company, but as a brand. Solution as a brand will have more of an impact on the world than just being a crypto company.

Solution Token has adapted a process in which we can still give 100% of donations<span className="hide-text"> without taking administrative fees! With multiple platforms of the company, we are able to create a positive income stream in both crypto and fiat currencies, which will help sustain the future of the company without finding our finances running out.
